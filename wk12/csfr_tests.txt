Test Results - CSRF Protection with Token

1. Submitting the form from csfr_form.php:
   - Result: Login works successfully when correct credentials and valid CSRF token are submitted.
   - Message: "✅ Login successful!"

2. Submitting the form from csfr.html:
   - Result: Login fails due to missing or invalid CSRF token.
   - Message: "⚠️ Invalid CSRF token!"

3. Modifying the token value manually:
   - Result: Login fails with "Invalid CSRF token!" even if username/password are correct.

Conclusion:
The CSRF token mechanism correctly prevents unauthorized or forged requests from succeeding.
