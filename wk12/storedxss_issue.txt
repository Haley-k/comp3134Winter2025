Issue(s) Identified in storexss.php:

1. Stored XSS Vulnerability:
   - The content from 'storedxss.txt' is rendered directly to the browser without sanitization.
   - This allows execution of malicious JavaScript code if an attacker stores a script in the file.

2. Lack of Output Encoding:
   - No HTML escaping or encoding is applied to the file contents before rendering.
   - This violates the rule of output encoding for user-generated content.

3. Potential Redirection Attack:
   - The stored script redirects the user to another PHP file, which could be used to phish or launch further attacks.
